# Predicting-Employees-under-Stress-

### Problem Statement
#### With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, business and organizations have adapted to unconventional and different working styles and patterns, like working from home, working with limited employees in the office premise, etc. With the new normal here to stay for the recent future, employees have also adapted to different working environment and routines, which has also resulted in fatigue and stress for many, as they adapt to the new normal and adjust their personal and professional lives. 

#### Employees may feel stressed when they are unable to cope with the prolonged uncertainty and pressure. Other factors leading to stress may include feeling isolated while working remotely, lower wages or salaries, lack of opportunity for advancement or growth, unmanageable workload, extended working hours, unsatisfactory work environment, lack of connect with the team, lack of ability and skill to cope with the work apart from the fear of catching the virus.

#### Spotting early signs of stress among employees will help employers identify and address the scenario, and hence help in reducing its impact on the employee and on the organization. 

#### A company, ABC Corporation with around 20k employees is quite vigilant about the employee's mental state and hence wants to identify any such employees who might be under work-stress pre-emptively, so that appropriate remedial measures can be taken for them.  

#### The company rolled out a survey for the employees and their managers and collected data from their counseling team to identify the employees who have been through counseling for stress in the last 6 months. This information combined with the data from the HR records forms the basis of this data case. 

#### Based on this data, the company wants to build a model that can help predict if an employee is likely to be under work stress or not. 

- Hence Created a model which predicts if a person is stressed or not with 90+ accuracy using XGBoost.
### STEPS:

1.  Imported the data
2.  The data was totally unstructured hence converted the data into structured format.
3.  Dropped unnecessary columns.
4.  Converted the datatypes of the columns .
5.  More cleaning of the data.
6.  Checked for missing and Duplicate values.
7.  Used KNN imputer to impute the missing values
8.  Checked for correlation to see if any independent varible is corelated to any other independent.
9.  EDA(refer in the notebook all the insight of the analysis are well commented)
10. One hot encoding of the data
11. Standard scalling 
!2. Applying different models.
13. Using hyper parameter tunning for better accuracy.
14. Saving the model.
!5. ALL DONE!
